Here I will try to create 2 web-pages connected with DB.

1. 1st web-page is a web-form where user inputs First Name, Last Name and email. The note will be stored in DB and also contains creation date information;
- [ ] install and run Django
- [ ] create a form
- [ ] save the form to DB
 
3. 2nd web-page will display all notes and date creation info.
- [ ] show the table with data for DB
